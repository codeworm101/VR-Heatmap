# Heatmap Visualization in Unity

### Overview
This repository provides a Unity solution for visualizing heatmap data on the surface of game objects. Heatmaps are commonly used for analyzing spatial data distribution and activity intensity. With this solution, you can easily integrate heatmap visualization into your Unity projects.

### Implemented Functionalities
- **Replay Functionality Integration**: Utilize InsightXRsdk to enable replay functionality, allowing for the playback of recorded interactions.
- **Focus Points Tracking**: Track focus points using raycasts from the user's head position, providing insights into where attention is concentrated within the scene.
- **Heatmap Visualization with Custom Shader**: Implement heatmap visualization using a custom shader, enabling real-time updates based on interactions within the scene.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Add Heatmap Material**:
   - Navigate to the `Materials` folder.
   - Select the `HeatmapMaterial` and add it to the GameObject you wish to visualize the heatmap on.

2. **Ensure Mesh Collider**:
   - Make sure the GameObject has a Mesh Collider attached. This collider is necessary for rendering the heatmap on the object's surface.

3. **Add Heatmap Script**:
   - Navigate to the `Scripts` folder.
   - Attach the `Heatmap.cs` script to any GameObject with the heatmap material applied.
   - Drag and drop the heatmap material from the GameObject onto the `Material` field of the Heatmap script in the Inspector.

4. **Testing**:
   - Once the setup is complete, you're ready to test the heatmap visualization.
   - Run the Unity scene and observe the heatmap updating in real-time based on interactions with the scene.

## Testing the Implemented Scene
To test the implemented scene, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `Assets` folder.
2. Open the `Heatmap` folder.
3. Go to the `Scenes` folder.
4. Click on the `HeatmapTestScene` folder.
5. Open the scene file within this folder.
6. Run the scene to observe the heatmap visualization in action.
7. Interact with the scene to generate heatmap data and see it updating in real-time.

## Testing the Replay Functionality with InsightXRsdk
To test the replay functionality using InsightXRsdk, proceed as follows:
1. Navigate to the `Assets` folder.
2. Open the `Replay` folder.
3. Click on the `Replay Scene`.
4. Open the scene file within this folder.
5. Ensure that the InsightXRsdk package is properly installed in your Unity project.
6. Run the scene to activate the replay functionality.
